# Greedy Best First Search and A* Search
This project implements Greedy Best First Search and A* Search algorithms in Python. Both algorithms are implemented in a generic way, so they can be used for any graph and any heuristic function. The project includes a sample graph and heuristic function to demonstrate the working of the algorithms.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
